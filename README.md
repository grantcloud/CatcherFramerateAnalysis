# CatcherFramerateAnalysis

This repository contains all the files necessary to run and create the MLB_Catcher_Framerates.ipynb

This was a personal project I started in my free time to delve into the world of data analytics, specifically through the lens of baseball. The MLB_Catcher_Framerates.ipynb is intended to be informative on a common baseball topic to someone with a baseball background, as well as explanative of the process I went through during the creation of the notebook to someone interested in the computer science aspect of it.
