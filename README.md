# CatcherFramerateAnalysis

This repository contains all the files necessary to run and create the MLB_Catcher_Framerates.ipynb

This was a personal project I started in my free time to delve into the world of data analytics, specifically through the lens of baseball. The MLB_Catcher_Framerates.ipynb is intended to be informative on a common baseball topic to someone with a baseball background, as well as explanative of the process I went through during the creation of the notebook to someone interested in the computer science aspect of it.

The master_statcast.db file created in input [1] of the notebook takes several hours to create and is too large to upload to github, the .csv files shared are created from the .db file and are much smaller, only including the data absolutely necessary to perform analysis. If you wish to play with the data yourself, I recommend using the premade .csv files
